# Starbound Admin Mods
A collection of tools, powers, and items for admins to use in a Starbound server to create new beautiful worlds and have fun with their friends!

#### The Excavator 
A pick that destroys any block instantly in a 10x10 square, use it to easily carve out massive regions of space to build houses, arenas, or any other building you could desire! However, be careful when you use it as you could easily become overwhelmed by its raw power.
